# detect-IoT
Detect_IoT is a research work carried out by Yuba Siwakoti at the DoD Center of Excellence in AI &ML at Howard University to detect compromised IoT Infrastructures using public data available at https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets?keywords=variot&locale=en under the VARIoT project co-financed by the Connecting Europe Facility of the European Union.

This work detects compromised IoT devices using machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, and Random Forest and Ensemble methods. Performances are compared for metrics Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. Additionally, the significance of features is evaluated for the performance of the models and an enhanced curated (preprocessed, class-balanced, feature-reduced) dataset is presented for further research on IoT network behavior data. 

Overall detection metrics are excellent in all models, however, the ensemble method outperforms others in SMOTE balanced dataset with 98 percent F1-Score with 99 percent Precision. 

The output of this study is presented as a paper and is accepted for publication at Mobihoc'23 (AIoT) that can be available for citation with DOI https://doi.org/10.1145/3565287.3616529.
The accepted paper and enhanced dataset are available for personal/research use only in this repo. Please look first page of the published paper regarding detailed permission.
